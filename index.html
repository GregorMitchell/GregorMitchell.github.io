          <h2>DRIVR - An at Home Golf Swing Trainer</h2>
          <p>
            For my Honours Project I decided to create an at home golf swing analyser using Unity and Arduino.
            The system uses an IR sensor and a Gyroscope to measure the speed and angle of the user's swing, which
            are then transmitted to Unity using Bluetooth serial ports. The golf ball flight is then calculated and
            simulated to the user using the Unity game engine.

            terrain generation using Perlin Noise.

          <p>
            As a team of 10 we were tasked with creating an online quizzing application to be used by a group of
            friends. We chose to create Crane-ium, a webapp designed to allow users to host an online quiz in which
            they get to choose the categories. The host can then invite up to 10 friends to join in the fun. The
            purpose of this task was to allow us to become more familiar with working in a large team, giving us a
            chance to practice things like Agile methodologies and source control. Craneware, who we have worked with
            in the past acted as the client for the project, allowing us to obtain requirements and pitch our ideas to
            them

          <p>
            For our Games Programming module, we were tasked with creating a game of our choosing. We were required 
            to come up with an idea, plan and then implement the game using an engine of our choosing. I created
            Outbreak, a top-down zombie shooter that requires you to cure the zombies, as you play as a doctor sworn
            to their Hippocratic oath. The game features path-finding AI for the zombies, meaning they can chase you
            all around the map. I decided to use Godot as my engine for this game, as I had prior experience using it.

            This project required us to create a website which allows users to compare the cost of different medical
            procedures throughout the United States. The website required both a frontend and a backend, meaning we
            had to split into 2 development teams. This module was our first experience working in a large development
            group, meaning it provided us with vital, necessary experience on how to communicate properly in order
            to achieve our goal. We also got our first taste of developing a product whilst working in an Agile
            environment.

            I took this job as a way of supporting myself through University. As Patisserie Valerie is a busy
            city-centre
            caf√©, I am often found in high pressure situations, where my failure to perform could result in a bad
            experience for a customer. This could lead to bad reviews, tarnishing the reputation of the chain. Despite
            this, I am always able to succeed, and I somewhat thrive in these high-pressure situations. During my time
            at the cafe, I am used to working in a team to reach the goal set for us. I am able to help out a fellow
            colleague in order to complete the job successfully.

            I took his job as a way of making extra money and gaining good life experience whilst still in school. For

            therefore entrusted with additional responsibilities, overseeing the dining room, telling other staff what
            needed done and learning how to delegate jobs. During this time, I also had to train new staff on how the
            restaurant was run, how to wait a table and how to clean up.

              My main passion in life is rooted in video games. Some of my earliest memories are of playing
